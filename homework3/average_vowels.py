# File: average_vowels.py

# You’re curious about the average number of vowels compared to consonants in a paragraph.

# --- 1. Counting Vowels ---
# Write a return function that takes a string as input.
# The function should return a tuple containing:
#     (number of vowels, number of consonants)
# Name this function: counting_vowels_and_consonants()
# Hint: You can use .isalpha() to check if a character is a letter.

#   - Split the paragraph into individual sentences.
